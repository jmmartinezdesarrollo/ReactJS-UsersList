## **Technical proof**

### The goal of this technical proof is to create an app similar to the one provided at this link: https://midu-react-11.surge.sh/.

To achieve this, you must use the API provided by https://randomuser.me/.

The steps to follow:

- [x] Fetch 100 rows of data using the API.
- [x] Provide the option to color rows as shown in the example.
- [x] Allow the data to be sorted by country as demonstrated in the example.
- [x] Enable the ability to delete a row as shown in the example.
- [x] Implement a feature that allows the user to restore the initial state, meaning that all deleted rows will be recovered.
- [x] Handle any potential errors that may occur.
- [x] Implement a feature that allows the user to filter the data by country.
- [x] Avoid sorting users again the data when the user is changing filter by country.
- [x] Sort by clicking on the column header.
